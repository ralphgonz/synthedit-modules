Notes for NewWave filter
RG 06/26/04

A "dirty" noise at start and end of notes occurs on the
laptop. Looking at the unfiltered input directly (using
Wave Recorder module), there is significant ringing at
about 25 Hz following notes (and preceding?!). Maybe this
is an artifact of the laptop's A-D converter or analog
stage or some digital HP filter upstream.

Or maybe it is just a characteristic of many inputs to
have a LF modulation on rollout, which can fool newwave
into sounding dirty.

Using a HP filter around 400 Hz helps a lot. But make sure
this filter doesn't itself ring.

More likely is that the ringing is the mic. I compared
the laptop internal mic vs the Sound Concepts mic, and
also the SC mic using UA-20 interface. All were about
the same however.

Ah, I think the culprit is actually room reflections,
so you get the delayed transient, at lower amplitude,
tacked onto the decay. I tested this with damping material
(a comforter draped over the source+mic) and that eliminated
most of the decay ringing.
